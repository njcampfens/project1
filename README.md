# Project 1

Web application connecting to a database containing information about books, users and reviews.

In the templates folder we can find the different html files which are used. All inherit from the layout.html template and the book_list.html file inherits from book_search.html (as the former lists the books queried in the latter).

In import.py we insert ll the books contained in books.csv ino the database.

In application.py, we define all the backend code to make all the functions of interest of our page.
